## Introduction

[Provide a detailed introduction to your project. Explain the purpose of the project, the problem it solves, and the target audience. For example:  
This project uses a pre-trained CNN model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset and generate Grad-CAM heatmaps to visualize the regions of the image that influenced the model's predictions. The project also includes tools for analyzing neuron influences and generating explanations for predictions.]

## Features

- **CIFAR-10 Dataset Filtering:** Filter the dataset to include specific classes (e.g., airplane, automobile, bird).
- **Model Prediction:** Use a pre-trained CNN model to classify images.
- **Grad-CAM Heatmaps:** Generate heatmaps to visualize feature activations.
- **Neuron Influence Analysis:** Analyze the influence of neurons on predictions.
- **Explainability:** Generate human-readable explanations for model predictions.
